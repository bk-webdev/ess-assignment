# ESS Frontend Assignment
Develop two solutions that are cross-platform compatible and delivers the same functionality and styling that exists in the index.html page without the use of an iframe. 

## Getting Started
1. open index.html in an iframe supported browser to be able to see the iframe's content (ex: Chrome)
2. Code away!

## Requirements
* Come up with two solutions to solve this problem. 
* In the included README.md please include a brief explanation as to why each solution was chosen.
* ** The index.html styling should only be dependent on the main.css file. **
* ** The content that was previously rendered by the iframe should not be affected by the main.css file but should still have styling. **
* The solutions should be compatible across all browsers (Edge, IE, Chrome, Firefox, Mobile)


## For each solution please provide a brief explanation below.

I was only able to come up with one solution and that was to use CSS and a little Javascript to replace the iframe. CSS handles the popup function and Javascript controls the next back button to display the "two" pages.
